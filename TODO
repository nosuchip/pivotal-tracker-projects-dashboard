Basically I want to know how "done" we are on an epic. Done stories
are "Accepted" - everything else is not done.

So for Test 1 - there are 7 points done out of 25 points and for Test
2 there are 7 out of 23.

Finally I would like 4 or 5 project status donuts to show up nicely on
a 1900 x 1200 monitor. (
What I meant by the last point was that 4-5 projects, and all their
donuts, should show up nicely. That could be as many as 20 donuts I'd
think. We might re-think putting each project in its own box and just
putting donuts next to one another.
)

=============================

So the 'shopping' doughnut for 'Test 2' should I *think* these map:

- 7 points that are green (current_state = accepted)
- 4 points that are yellow (current_state = delivered, finished,
started, rejected)
- 1 point that is blue (current_state = unscheduled)
- 11 points that are gray (everything left over)

No need to calculate completion dates.
Try and think about how to show as many of projects / epics in one
view.

This project will be popular in, and outside of my company. Many will
use it as an open source thing.
